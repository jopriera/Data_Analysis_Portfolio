# Project 1: Data Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset to make it ready for analysis. 

The dataset used represents online retail transactions, including customer information, product details, and sales data. The main goal was to transform messy and incomplete data into a structured and reliable format.

### Key highlights:
- Identified and addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Standardized data formats, such as dates and text fields.
- Created new features to enhance the dataset's usability.
- Developed a reproducible cleaning pipeline for future use.

### Tools:
Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook were used to perform the cleaning tasks.

### Results:
The cleaned dataset is now fully prepared for further analysis and modeling. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world, messy datasets and apply professional data cleaning techniques.
