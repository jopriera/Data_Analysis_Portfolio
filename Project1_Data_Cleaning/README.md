# Project 1: Data Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset to make it ready for analysis. 

The dataset used represents e-commerce transactions, including customer demographics, product categories, and purchase information. The main goal was to transform incomplete and messy data into a structured and reliable format for business insights.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Quality:** Identified and resolved missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Standardization:** Ensured consistent formats for dates, text fields, and numeric values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhanced the dataset's utility by creating meaningful derived features.
- **Reproducibility:** Developed a clear and reusable data cleaning pipeline.

### Tools Used:
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive and well-documented workflow.

### Results:
The cleaned dataset is now fully prepared for further analysis and modeling. Key insights include identifying customer spending patterns, understanding regional distributions, and highlighting popular product categories. This project demonstrates my ability to clean and organize real-world datasets professionally, ensuring they are ready for advanced analytics.
