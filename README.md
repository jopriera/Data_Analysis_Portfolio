# Project 3: Predictive Modeling

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict loan default risks using historical data. The goal was to identify key factors influencing loan outcomes and build a reliable prediction system.

### Key highlights:
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Built and compared multiple models, including logistic regression and decision trees.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model.

### Tools:
Python, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook were used for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

### Results:
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85%, with strong recall for identifying high-risk loans. This project highlights my skills in building and evaluating machine learning models while providing actionable insights.
